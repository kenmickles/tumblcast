tumblcast
=============
Quick and dirty script to convert a Tumblr's audio posts into a podcast feed.

Things to consider:
-------------------
* This is not well tested. It works for me so far.
* I'm fairly certain this will only work with external audio files. Tumblr doesn't seem to allow direct downloads of the audio they host.
* You'll probably want to put this behind Feedburner or something similar. Following the audio redirects to get the actual MP3 locations is slooooooow.
